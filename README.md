# CDC-COVID19-Trends
My first EDA! An analysis on the CDC's data on COVID19 from Jan 2020 to Jan 2022. Utilizing data visualizations to better understand how each state was effected during this era of the pandemic. 

Here you will find a summary of my work in which I imported, cleaned, visualized, and analyzed the CDC's data on COVID19 by state over the duration of two years (Jan 2020- Jan 2022).
The Analysis primarily focused on trends during the pandemic by state. A deeper dive on how each state was effected during that era of the pandemic.
The files uploaded are the summary as an ipynb, py script, and html output.
Furthermore, the csv of the data used for the analysis is attatched, incase one chooses to run the script and analysis themselves.
